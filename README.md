# Breast Cancer Detection

- **Breast cancer** is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment and survival. This repository aims to contribute to the field of medical diagnostics by providing a comprehensive, open-source solution for breast cancer detection using machine learning techniques.

- Our approach leverages state-of-the-art algorithms to analyze mammographic images and predict the presence of breast cancer with high accuracy. The repository includes:

   - **Data Preprocessing**: Methods for cleaning and preparing mammographic data, including normalization and augmentation techniques.
  - **Feature Extraction**: Techniques for extracting relevant features from images, such as texture, shape, and intensity-based features.
  - **Model Development**: Implementation of various machine learning models, including support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNN).
